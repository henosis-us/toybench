# ToyBench: Evaluating Agentic Planning, Action, and Iterative Refinement

**ToyBench** evaluates the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to **plan, take actions agentically over time, and refine outputs based on feedback**. Our vision is to create a method for measuring how well LLMs translate complex requirements and high-level goals into tangible, **"valid" sequences of actions or artifacts** within defined environments, assessed through a practical, multi-step process that may involve interaction and iteration. This benchmark will be continually updated over time.

Benchmark runs across **Tic-Tac-Toe** (strategic planning, multi-turn horizon), **File System** management (complex instruction following, state tracking, high-round horizon), and iterative **Solar System** generation (visual refinement, code generation, multimodal feedback, limited-round horizon) demonstrate significant variation in capabilities between different models and providers and highlight the distinct challenges posed by each task type and time horizon. 

For the Solar System task, a new **Differentiated Score** has been introduced to better capture partial successes, calculated as: ((Number of Score 3 attempts * 1.0) + (Number of Score 2 attempts * 0.3)) / Total Attempts * 100. This provides a more nuanced evaluation, accounting for models that make progress but do not fully achieve the goal.

**Core Goals:**
1.  **Evaluate Agentic Capabilities:** Assess the LLM's ability to act as an agent â€“ perceiving environmental state, planning, and executing actions or generating artifacts.
2.  **Measure Planning & Reasoning:** Test multi-step planning, reasoning, and feedback incorporation under task constraints.
3.  **Assess Action/Output Validity & Effectiveness:** Determine if actions/artifacts are valid and contribute effectively towards the goal over time.
4.  **Benchmark Goal Achievement:** Quantify success rates (`pass@1`, `pass@k`) across multiple attempts.
5.  **Analyze Performance Horizons / Refinement Cycles:** Understand how performance changes with allowed steps/rounds.
6.  **Compare Agent Performance:** Provide a consistent framework to compare LLMs/strategies across diverse agentic tasks.

## Core Concepts
*   **Agent:** The LLM being evaluated.
*   **Environment:** Simulated context (game, file system, browser loop) with rules, states, feedback.
*   **State:** Current situation provided to the agent.
*   **Goal:** High-level objective.
*   **Actions:** Permissible operations or generated artifacts.
*   **Turns/Steps/Rounds:** Interactions (State -> Action -> New State/Feedback). Limited by `--rounds` (except TTT).
*   **Validity:** Whether an action/artifact meets environment rules or basic structural requirements.
*   **Feedback (Iterative):** Information (logs, evaluations) about the previous action's outcome.
*   **Rendering (Visual):** Using tools (Selenium) to process output (HTML) into a representation (screenshot).
*   **Intermediate Evaluation (Iterative):** Assessment within a multi-step process for feedback (e.g., evaluating a screenshot).
*   **Final Evaluation:** Assessment at the end to determine the success score (1-3).

## Evaluation Methodology: Agent Interaction & Outcome Scoring
ToyBench uses interaction loops and outcome-based scoring:
1.  **Initialization:** Set up task environment and goal.
2.  **Interaction Loop (per Attempt, up to `--rounds` or game end):**
    *   Agent receives state/feedback + goal.
    *   Agent outputs action/artifact.
    *   Validation against rules/structure. Invalid output leads to failure/penalty.
    *   Valid action updates state (TTT, FS) or triggers rendering/intermediate eval (SolarGen).
    *   Environment generates new state/feedback.
3.  **Data Capture:** Log states, actions, validity, feedback, evaluations (`attempt_results.jsonl`).
4.  **Final Scoring (per Attempt):** Assess final state/artifact against criteria (`<task>_finaleval.txt` or deterministic checks).
    *   **Score 1 (Failure):** Goal not met, critical error, invalid action, failed eval.
    *   **Score 2 (Partial):** Progress made, valid outputs, but goal not fully met or minor errors.
    *   **Score 3 (Success):** Goal fully achieved via valid steps within limits, passing final eval.

For the Solar System Generator task, a **Differentiated Score** is now used in reporting to better reflect partial achievements. This score is calculated as ((Number of Score 3 attempts * 1.0) + (Number of Score 2 attempts * 0.3)) / Total Attempts * 100, providing a weighted average that highlights models capable of iterative refinement even if not fully successful.

## Reporting Metrics
*   **`pass@1` (Reliability):** `(# Successful Attempts) / (Total Attempts Completed)`. Average success rate per try.
*   **`pass@k` / `pass@20` (Capability):** 100% if *at least one* of the first `k` (typically 20) attempts succeeded (Score 3), 0% otherwise. Often labeled "Any Success in Run".
*   **Differentiated Score (SolarGen-Specific):** For the Solar System task, a weighted score incorporating partial successes (Score 2 at 0.3 weight) to better differentiate models.
*   **Overall ToyBench Score:** Calculated as the **Average of TTT `pass@1`, FileSystem `pass@1`, and SolarGen Differentiated Score across all included tasks** if run with a consistent attempt count. The results presented below use 20 attempts per task where data is available. Models are only included if they have a completed run (20 attempts) for all three tasks (Tic-Tac-Toe, FileSystem, SolarGen). Grok "fast" variants and "-B1" QualityCompute variants are grouped with their base models for this summary where appropriate or if the base model was tested under that provider.

## Overall Performance Summary (Varied Horizons, 20 Attempts per Task)
This table summarizes the performance of models tested across Tic-Tac-Toe, FileSystem, and SolarGen. The "Overall Score" represents the average of TTT `pass@1`, FileSystem `pass@1`, and SolarGen Differentiated Score based on available 20/20 runs for all three tasks.

**Notes:**
*   The benchmark continues to differentiate model capabilities. The introduction of the SolarGen Differentiated Score (weighting Score 2 at 0.3) provides a more nuanced evaluation, highlighting models that make partial progress. This update benefits models like `gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25` and `grok-3-beta`, which have higher partial success rates.
*   `o3` remains the top performer overall. The new Gemini Flash model (`05-20`) achieves a new flash state-of-the-art overall score of 54.50%, driven by improvements in TTT and FS, with its Solar Differentiated Score adding nuance.
*   `grok-3-mini-beta` and its `quality_compute` variants excel at Tic-Tac-Toe
*   `gpt-4.1` leads on the FileSystem task with 100% `pass@1`.
*   SolarGen remains challenging, but clearly diffentiates even models within the same family, with `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06` at 43.00% and `gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25` at 34.50%.

**Commentary:** Tic-Tac-Toe remains a strong differentiator. `grok-3-mini-beta` and its QC variants dominate. The new `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20` shows a massive jump to 80% `pass@1`. The new `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06` (May I/O) shows a notable regression to 30% `pass@1` from the March version's 65%, indicating challenges for some "thinking" models in this strategic, rule-bound task.

### Task: Complex File Organizer
*   **Rounds:** Typically 10 or 35 turns max.
*   *Tests complex instruction following, state tracking, conditional logic, command generation.*

**Commentary:** File System tests precise execution over a long time horizon. `grok-3-fast-beta` and `gpt-4.1` lead with perfect scores. The new `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20` improved to 70% `pass@1` from its previous iteration's 65%. Non thinking models excel at this task while thinking models seem to struggle. This can be abated through more RL compute or test time compute.

### Task: Solar System Generator (Iterative Refinement)
*   **Rounds:** Typically 3 turns max.
*   *Tests HTML/JS code generation, incorporating visual feedback, debugging from logs. Now includes a Differentiated Score for better nuance, weighting partial successes at 0.3.*
